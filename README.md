# cave
Design an ADT for a cave and a cave system. 

A system of caves is a group of connected underground tunnels. Design an ADT for a cave and a cave
system. An archaeologist should be able to add a newly discovered cave to a cave system. He/she can
enter this system through only one cave and exit the system only through a different cave. Duplicate
caves – based on GPS coordinates – are not permitted. Archaeologists should also be able to list the
caves in a given cave system.
